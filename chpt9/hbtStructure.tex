  Two materials can be used to fabricate a heterojunction transistor when their lattice constants are matched. Otherwise mismatch of lattice constants introduce a large number of inteface states and degrades the heterojunction operation.

  HBTs are mainly used for high speed switching devices in the microwave frequencies.
