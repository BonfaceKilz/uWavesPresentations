  \frametitle{Introduction}
  A Microwave Bipolar Transistors is a non-linear devices. Its principle of operation is similar to that of low frequency BJTs. \emph{Higher interelectrode capacitance, lead inductance} and \emph{transit time} limit the low frequency BJTs at \textbf{high frequencies}. Thus \emph{proper geometry} to reduce the above effects, \emph{process control, heat sinking and packaging} are first and foremost criteria for the designing of a high frequency transistor.

  All Microwave Bipolar Transistors are planar in form and of the n-p-n type. As mobility of electron($\mu_e$) is greater than that of hole($\mu_h$), hence electron emitted by the emitter of an n-p-n transistor will reach collector faster than the hole and which in turn the speed of operation.

  Moder Microwave Bipolar Transistors can operate at frequencies of upto 22 Ghz
