  \frametitle{Surface States In Practical Schottky Barrier Diodes}
  The barrier height in a practical barrier Schottky diode differs from an ideal case. In practice, Schottky Barrier Diodes involve a termination of crystal semiconductor lattice at the metal semiconductor boundary. The termination leads to production of surface states due to incomplete covalent bonds which affect the barrier height. There is also a thin layer of $SiO_2$ which also affects the barrier height. \emph{Because of this, for design of Schottky diodes, measured barrier height data is used as opposed to ideal values based on the work function of the isolated metal and semiconductor.}
